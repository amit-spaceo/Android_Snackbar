# Android_Snackbar

With the release of Android Lollipop 5.0, Google has introduced a new Android design support library with many tools and widgets such as [Android floating Action button](https://www.spaceotechnologies.com/create-floating-action-button-android-example/), Floating Label Android, Android Snackbar, and many others.With the help of this library, you can use material design tools for the pre lollipop Android devices.

Android Snackbar is basically same as the [Android Toast](https://www.spaceotechnologies.com/android-toast-message-example/), but with some additional features. This appears at the bottom of the screen and above all other elements of the screen. As said, the Android snackbar is just like Android Toast that has an option for user feedback.

In this Android tutorial, we’ll demonstrate how to implement [snackbar in Android app](https://www.spaceotechnologies.com/android-snackbar-example/) with both with and without option to undo last action taken.

Though, it’s not looking quite appealing, but you can consult with [Android App development company](https://www.spaceotechnologies.com/android-app-development/) to hire UI/UX designer to create impression user experience for your Android app development project.
